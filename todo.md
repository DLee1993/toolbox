# Todo list

---

### General

-   [ ] Fix ui design for all tools

-   [ ] Multiple tools use a popover/drawer with command component, maybe find a solution to have a global component all tools can pull in from, pass optional args? Url based?...

### Focus timer

-   [ ] Organise functions and components of the focus timer
-   [ ] Fix disabled attribute on restart button
-   [ ] Add a user input for manual time changes

### Link in bio

-   [ ] Find a solution to secure user information, while still using the url to parse the data

### Notepad

-   [ ] In mobile, use cards instead of the table, this aids in ux and readability of tasks.

### timezones

-   [ ] Fix search input, search function doesn't work for all timezones.
